# Portal Travels: Final VR Project 
This project is about using Google Cardboard and exploring the world of Virtual Reality using **Unity 5.0**. We have also used **Maya, 3DS Blender, SketchUp and Photoshop** for making the enviornments. 

**There are a total of 5 portals** -
  1. Home Portal (where it all begins)
  2. Tile Portal 
  3. Forest Portal
  4. Arabic Nights Portal
  5. Mountain Drop Portal

#### Team Members

Since we used Google Cardboard to demo the 3D renditions of our work, please find screenshots below. You can download the .apk files from our repository and test them on your Android device.
